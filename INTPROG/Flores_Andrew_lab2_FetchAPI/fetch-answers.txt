--GUIDE QUESTIONS--

1. What are the main difference between XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API?

   -Both XMLHttpRequest and fetch are ways to make asynchronous HTTP requests in JavaScript.
    However, they differ significantly in syntax, promise handling and features.
    XMLHttpRequest is event-driven and requires attaching event listeners to handle response/
    error states. On the other hand, fetch provides a more straightforward and intuitive way
    of making HTTP requests. It is Promise-based and returns a promise that resolves with
    the response or rejects with an error.
 
2. Why is the Fetch API considered more modern and readable?

   -Because of its cleaner syntax, promise-based approach and imrpoved handling of features 
    like error handling, headers and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing(CORS).

3. What is the purpose of the .then() and .catch() methods in Fetch?
 
   -The .then() and .catch() methods are used for handling the result of the request.
    The .then() is used for a successful request or resolution of a promise. it takes a
    callback function as an argument. The callback function will then take the response
    object from the request as its argument. The .catch() method is used to handle errors 
    or rejections. It takes a callback function that will be executed if an error occurs.
 
4. What happens when you send a POST request to the placeholder API?
   
   -When you send a POST request to the placeholder API, you're creating or submiting data
    to its server. The placeholder API will then simulates the server-side processing of 
    recieved data and responds with a status code indicating the success or failure of the 
    operation.
