TASK 3: GUIDE QUESTIONS

1. What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?

   - ReadyState is a property that indicates the current state of theXMLHttpRequest, for example, if the readyState is 0, 
     that means the open() method is not yet been called. if it's 4, that means the data transfer is complete. status on 
     the other hand is a property that tells whether the request is successfull or not. for example, 404 means the resource
     cant be found while 200 means the request is successfull.
  
2. How can you make the request asynchronous?
   
   - Inside your XMLHttpRequest.open() method, set the 3rd argument to true. 1st argument is the http request methd, 2nd 
     argument is the url to which the request will be sent and the 3rd is boolean value for asynchronous request. 
      
3. Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?

   - In synchronous request the browser's main thread blocked while waiting for a server response. This freezes the user
     interface, making the application unresponsive. In asynchronous communication, the request run in the background,
     keeping the user interface responsive. This allows the user to multitask.
